# SCORE
Code used in the paper "Score matching enables causal discovery of nonlinear additive noise models", Rolland et al., ICML 2022.

Need to install R and a few packages in R.

The R files are taken directly from the CAM package https://rdrr.io/cran/CAM/man/CAM-package.html.

The code in demo_SCORE.py generates synthetic data as described in the paper. To test it, simply run the following command.

```
python demo_SCORE.py
```
